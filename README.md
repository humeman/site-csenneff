The source code and CI pipeline for [https://csenneff.com](https://csenneff.com).

A portfolio website developed using good ol' HTML, CSS, and JSS -- no frameworks or libraries involved. Designed to show off my work/experience in an easy to sift through format.

## the CI pipeline
An Ansible playbook which keeps everything up-to-date, triggered locally using a Taskfile or via Git commits using GitHub Actions. Features automatic PR verification as well.
